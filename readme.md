### How it works
- Download the zip file to your computer and browse the players folder.
- Select one of the available players, go to this folder and open the "index.html" main web page.
- Once there click on **Jugar** to start game.

If you want to add another player to the game
- Select another of the available players, go to this folder and open the "index.html" main web page.

During the game ...
- Only when you click "siguiente" the timer will be running.
- As soon as you click "comprobar" the timer stops and you can:
	* Check whether the answer said by the player is correct or wrong.
	* Continue with the same player depending on the answer.	
	* Change to other player in the next navigation tab of your browser.

### How to configure players and modify questions
 - Download the zip file to your computer and open the folder named "players", inside it you will find one folder for each player, and inside each one there is a folder named "js", and in that folder there is a file called "words.js". Just change this file and you will have a new buch of questions ready.
	
	If you want to configure the game for more players just duplicate the folder "Team_0" and change the name to "Team_2/3/...". 
	Then enter in the js folder and edit the words file. Iside that file you can also modify the name of the team/player.


 Just play ...
