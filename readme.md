### How it works
- Download the zip file to your computer and enter into the players folder
- Select one of the available players and open the index.html main web page.
- Once there click on **Jugar** to start game.

If you want to add another player open the second index.html for the second player.
 - Only when you click "siguiente" the timer is running.
	- As soon as you click "comprobar" the timer stops and you can change to the other player or continue with the same depending if the answer is 
	correct or it was wrong.

### How to configure players and modify questions
 - Download the zip file to your computer and enter on each player folder, inside you will find a folder called js, and in that folder there is a 
	file called "words.js". Just change this file and you will have a new buch of questions ready.
	
	If you want to add a new polayer just duplicate the folder "Team_0" and change the name to "Team_2/3/..."


 Just play ...
